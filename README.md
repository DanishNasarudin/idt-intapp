## Warranty Entry App for Ideal Tech PC

The company's warranty department had been using manually written warranty details for every customer's computer that was submitted. This introduces slow data collection where the staff require to record every detail manually in front of the customer. On top of that, misinformation could happen if the details are not written clearly.

To solve the issue above, a web app is made to allow for digitised data collection process and storing, with customised UI, made specifically for the company.

The information is also synchronised with websockets across devices as the web app is used at all the company's branch.
